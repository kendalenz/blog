        <p>Hi, I'm Kendal Enz. I'm a fullstack software engineer with a background in communications, journalism and creative writing. I enjoy building websites and writing about harnessing the power of AI to assist with coding and writing tasks. I hold an MA in Writing with a Concentration in Fiction from Johns Hopkins University, a BA in Communications with a Concentration in Journalism from Hood College and a Certificate of Software Engineering from Fullstack Academy. I'm based in Brooklyn, NY, and when I'm not working, I enjoy going on long runs through the city.</p>
